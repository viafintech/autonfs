# The path to the AutoNFS script location
# Default: /usr/local/bin/autonfs.sh
SCRIPTPATH="/usr/local/bin/autonfs.sh"

# Set the log level
# LOGLEVEL=2 debug, LOGLEVEL=1 normal logging, LOGLEVEL=0 disabled
# Default: 1
LOGLEVEL=1

# The hostname or IP address of the NFS Server
# Can be an resolvable DNS Name like "nfsserver.example.com"
# or an IP like "10.10.10.2"
FILESERVER="nfsserver.example.com"

# The NFS protocol version used for the server checks
# Using a specific nfs protocol version prevents "unknown version" syslog
# entries caused by rpcinfo with every check call
# Default: 3 (can be 2, 3 or 4)
NFSVERS=3

# Define some mount options which should be used for (re-)mounting the NFS shares
# Default: "-o rw,hard,intr,tcp,actimeo=3"
# Explanation:
#   rw   - mount read/write
#   hard - 
MOUNTOPT="-o rw,hard,intr,tcp,actimeo=3"

# Server Check interval (in seconds)
# Default: 60 seconds
INTERVAL=60

# The shares that need to be mounted defined as an array
# Example with 2 shares: MOUNTS=( "/mnt/share" "/var/remoteShare2|/var/localShare2" )
# Explanation: AutoNFS will try to mount both shares whereas in the second
# mountpoint there are a different remote and local mountpoint which are divided by
# the MOUNTSDELIMITER below. The default is the pipe.
MOUNTS=( "/mnt/share" )
MOUNTSDELIMITER="|"
